# csgo-internal

A VERY VERY basic csgo internal cheat. Made in a day to help me get a better understanding of how internal cheats work

Features:
- glow
- chams
- fov changer
- radar stuff (makes enemies visible on the radar


(i pretty much just converted my external to internal, which is why the codebase looks very similar to an external cheat)
